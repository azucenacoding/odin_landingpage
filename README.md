# odin_landingpage
Hello. This is my take on the Landing Page using Flexbox project from the Odin Project. This README
will be used as a self-reflection + credits section if I decide to use other images/assets in the project.
Thank you for stopping by.

# Self reflection

- Start date: 1/28
- Finish date: 1/30

Hardest section(s): The landing container with the 4 pictures, the quote section, and the call to action section in terms of remembering how to use flexbox + CSS to make them work. I think I got it down though!

Overall, this project was actually challenging. After getting the header and the hero section finished, I had to go back to a specific flexbox exercise to get an idea on how the landing images section should be laid out.

Next, I had to style the quote section. Honestly, I might have just used padding as a band-aid as I didn't really know how to go about that whole section. Especially with the span at the end of the "quote".

Finally, the call to action section. This part was actually the trickiest, because it's essentially two parts: the actual call to action banner against its overall container. On top of that, the parts inside the banner was its own challenge as I had to group both the paragraph element and anchor element inside a div to get the intended effect as shown in the design image.

I am proud though, because I managed to finish this project and make it semi-responsive as well! Thank you for reading, good luck to anyone on the Foundations path.
